# What Is Image Preprocessing and Why Is It Important?
Image preprocessing is the process of manipulating raw image data into a usable and meaningful format. It allows you to eliminate unwanted distortions and enhance specific qualities essential for computer vision applications. Preprocessing is a crucial first step to prepare your image data before feeding it into machine learning models.

# Cropping:
Cropping images to different sizes and ratios creates new images from the same original. This exposes your model to different framings and compositions of the same content. You can create random crops of varying size, or target more specific crop ratios like squares.
